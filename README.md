# RNN---TensorFlow-vs-PyTorch
Jupyter Notebooks to estimate simple RNN models in TensorFlow and PyTorch

Both scripts are designed to enable a comparison of the model estimation with TensorFlow and PyTorch. 

It is recommended to open both Notebook files in Google Colab and execute them side by side.
